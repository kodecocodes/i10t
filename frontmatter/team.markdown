**Sam Davies** is a strange mashup of developer, writer and trainer. By day you'll find him recording videos for Razeware, writing tutorials, attending conferences and generally being a good guy. By night he's likely to be out entertaining people, armed with his trombone and killer dance moves. He'd like it very much if you were to follow him on twitter at @iwantmyrealname.
