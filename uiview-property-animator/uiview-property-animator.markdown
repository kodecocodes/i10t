Title: Property Animators
Prerequisites: UIView animations
Most important concepts: UIViewPropertyAnimator
 
* Introduction

Summary of property animator

* Getting Started [Theory]
    * More powerful timing functions than UIView animations
    * timing curves
    * springs
    * Introduce animalation project 
    * NOTE: a lot of maths theory in the screencast - maybe make the sample app more like a playground where you can see various options side by side? Some diagrams would help too
    
* Animalation one: timing curves [instruction]

Change timing of animation from UIView to property
Experiment with different timing curves, spring with initial velocity from gesture recognizer

* Pausing and Scrubbing [Theory]

What this means, how it benefits apps

* Animalation: pausing and scrubbing  [instruction]

Connect up scrubbing slider

* Reversing [Theory]

What this means, how you'd use it

* Animalation: reversing [instruction]

Reverse the animations as in the screencast, 
Impact on completion handlers

* Interruptibility [theory]

What it means, how it benefits an app

* Interruptibility [instruction]

Allow an in-flight update to be taken over by tapping somewhere else, so it smoothly turns to the new destination. Not sure how much of this is out of the box but it wasn't covered in the screencast.

* Working together [Theory and instruction]

Multiple property animators - how to animate multiple things - can do by adding additional animations as well as the multiple animators approach shown in the screencast
