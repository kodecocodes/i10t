# Chapter 6: SiriKit    

## Outline

(I think the division of information in the video is pretty much what we want for the chapter sections) 

- Introduction:
    - Siri, people asking for years to use it in their apps
    - Turns out it's a really hard problem and you need a lot of support from the frameworks to make it work - list the domains and the intents briefly
    - Discuss the issues with building and debugging
    - Discuss the chapter stages - Resolve, Confirm, Handle and custom UI
- Resolving
    - Theory about how intents work and how each intent will have different resolution handling
    - Instruction - build the extension as per the video steps and get the resolving part set up
- Confirmation
    - Theory about the confirmation stage and some of the differences between different intents and domains. 
    - Instruction - add the confirmation steps as per the video
- Handling
    - Theory about the handling stage and how this is set up in code
    - Instruction - add the handler as per the video
- Custom UI
    - Theory: why you'd want to do this and when, what are the possibilities and the limits
    - Instruction - add the custom UI as per the video
- Where to go from here:
    - To the apple store to replace the devices you smashed in a fit of rage :]
